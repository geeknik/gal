[![Chaos Ready](https://img.shields.io/badge/chaos-ready-purple.svg)](https://github.com/gal-lang/gal)

**The world's first programming language with native chaos engineering, formal verification, and Gödelian self-modification capabilities.**

GAL transforms the way we build distributed systems by making resilience, correctness, and evolution first-class language features rather than afterthoughts.

## 🌟 Why GAL?

Traditional languages force you to bolt on chaos testing, formal verification, and fault tolerance as external tools. GAL integrates these concepts at the language level, making it impossible to write fragile systems.

```gal
// This actor is automatically chaos-tested and formally verified
@chaos_resilient
@verify
actor PaymentProcessor {
    state balance: Money = 0
    
    // Mathematical proof that balance never goes negative
    proof balance_invariant: balance >= 0
    
    // Automatically tested with network failures, crashes, and delays
    on ProcessPayment(amount: Money) 
        requires amount > 0
        ensures balance == old(balance) + amount
    =>
        // Your business logic is automatically resilient
        balance = balance + amount
        send(audit_log, PaymentProcessed(amount))
}
```

## ✨ World-First Features

### 🌪️ **Native Chaos Engineering**
Test resilience as you code, not as an afterthought:
```gal
@chaos_test(faults: [MessageDrop(0.1), ActorCrash, NetworkPartition])
actor DistributedCache {
    // Automatically tested under failure conditions
}
```

### ⏮️ **Time-Travel Debugging**
Debug backwards through failures in distributed systems:
```gal
let trace = chaos.record_execution()
// Step backwards through the execution
debugger.time_travel(trace, step: -1)
```

### 🔄 **Self-Modifying Code with Proofs**
Systems that evolve and optimize themselves safely:
```gal
actor SelfOptimizing {
    on Optimize() =>
        let improved = synthesize_better_version(self)
        if prove_equivalent(self, improved) {
            self.hot_swap(improved)  // Safe runtime evolution
        }
}
```

### ✅ **Integrated Formal Verification**
Prove correctness as easily as writing tests:
```gal
@verify
actor ConsensusNode {
    proof consensus: all_nodes_agree() || no_decision_made()
    proof safety: at_most_one_value_chosen()
}
```

## 🚀 Quick Start

### Installation

```bash
# Install from source (requires Rust 1.70+)
git clone https://github.com/geeknik/gal
cd gal
cargo build --release

# Add to PATH
export PATH="$PWD/target/release:$PATH"
```

### Your First GAL Program

```gal
// hello_resilient.gal
actor HelloWorld {
    on Start =>
        println("Hello, resilient world!")
        
    // This actor automatically handles failures
    on Failure(error) =>
        println("Recovered from: {error}")
        self.restart()
}

// Chaos testing is built-in
#[test]
fn test_hello_survives_chaos() {
    let hello = spawn HelloWorld
    chaos.inject(ActorCrash)
    assert(hello.is_alive())  // Supervisor auto-restarts it
}
```

Run it:
```bash
galc hello_resilient.gal -o hello
./hello --chaos-enabled
```

    state replicas: Set<ActorRef> = {}
    
    @chaos_test(duration: 60s)
    @verify(consistency: "eventual")
    on Put(key, value) =>
        data[key] = value
        broadcast(replicas, Replicate(key, value))
}
```

supervisor WebSupervisor {
    strategy = ExponentialBackoff(initial: 100ms, max: 30s)
    
    on ActorCrashed(id, error) =>
        log.error("Worker {id} crashed: {error}")
        spawn_replacement_worker()
}
```

### Blockchain Consensus
```gal
@verify(safety: "agreement", liveness: "termination")
actor ConsensusNode {
    state blockchain: Chain = Chain::genesis()
    
    on ProposeBlock(block) =>
        if validate(block) {
            let votes = gather_votes(block, timeout: 5s)
            if votes.count() > nodes.count() * 2/3 {
                blockchain.append(block)
                broadcast(BlockAccepted(block))

## 🎯 Mission

**To make resilient, correct, evolving systems the default, not the exception.**

GAL empowers developers to build systems that:
- **Thrive under chaos** instead of merely surviving
- **Prove their correctness** instead of hoping for the best
- **Evolve and improve** instead of degrading over time
- **Debug the impossible** with time-travel through failures

---

*"In the spirit of Gödel, we've created a language that transcends its own limitations through self-reference, turning paradox into power and chaos into confidence."*
