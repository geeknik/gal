## Overview

GAL (G√∂delian Actor Language) is a revolutionary programming language that combines the safety and expressiveness of modern type systems with the power of actor-based concurrency, enhanced by unique chaos engineering and self-modification capabilities. Designed for building resilient, distributed systems that can withstand real-world failures and adapt to changing conditions.

### Key Features

- **Actor-Based Concurrency**: Built on the proven actor model for scalable, fault-tolerant systems
- **Memory Safety**: Rust-inspired ownership system prevents common programming errors
- **Chaos Engineering**: First-class support for fault injection and resilience testing
- **Formal Verification**: Integrated proof-carrying code and contract verification
- **G√∂delian Self-Modification**: Unique metaprogramming capabilities for adaptive systems
- **Zero-Cost Abstractions**: High-level features with performance comparable to C++

## Quick Start

### Installation

```bash
# Install from source (requires Rust 1.70+)
git clone https://github.com/gal-lang/gal
cd gal
cargo build --release

# Add to PATH
export PATH="$PWD/target/release:$PATH"
```

### Hello World

Create a file `hello.gal`:

```gal
actor Greeter {
    state greeting: String = "Hello"
    
    new create(message: String) =>
        greeting = message
        
    on "greet" =>
        println(greeting + ", World!")
}

actor Main {
    new create() =>
        let greeter = spawn Greeter("Welcome to GAL")
        send(greeter, "greet")
}
```

Compile and run:

```bash
galc hello.gal -o hello
./hello
```

Output:
```
Welcome to GAL, World!
```

### Your First Actor System

```gal
// A resilient counter with chaos testing
@chaos_test(faults: [MessageDrop(0.1), ActorRestart(0.05)])
actor Counter {
    state count: Int = 0
    
    // Formal specification
    invariant count >= 0
    
    on Increment =>
        count += 1
        reply(count)
    
    on Decrement =>
        requires count > 0  // Precondition
        count -= 1
        reply(count)
    
    on GetValue => reply(count)
}

actor Main {
    new create() =>
        let counter = spawn Counter
        
        // Test under chaos conditions
        chaos.enable([MessageDrop(0.1)])
        
        send(counter, Increment)
        send(counter, Increment)
        send(counter, GetValue)
}
```

## Language Features

### Actor Model
GAL uses the actor model for concurrency, where actors are lightweight, isolated units of computation that communicate via message passing.

### Chaos Engineering
Built-in support for fault injection and resilience testing:
- Message dropping and delays
- Actor crashes and restarts
- Network partitions
- System resource constraints

### Formal Verification
Integrated contract system for proving program correctness:
- Preconditions and postconditions
- Invariants and assertions
- Automated theorem proving

### Self-Modification
G√∂delian reflection capabilities allow programs to examine and modify their own structure:
- Runtime code generation
- Adaptive optimizations
- Self-healing systems
